# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a live cricket score tracking web application that addresses the critical problem of handling late-arriving score corrections in real-time broadcasting systems. The system simulates a scenario where scores are entered by a human operator and must handle corrections to past events without disrupting the ongoing real-time experience for users. The solution uses an event-sourced architecture with MongoDB for persistence and Socket.io for real-time updates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cricket score operator, I want to enter live cricket scores in real-time, so that viewers can see up-to-date match information immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an operator submits a score update THEN the system SHALL store the event in MongoDB with complete audit information
2. WHEN a score is entered THEN the system SHALL broadcast the updated score to all connected clients within 100ms
3. WHEN entering a score THEN the system SHALL validate that over is a positive number, ball is between 1-6, and runs are between 0-6
4. IF a score submission is invalid THEN the system SHALL return an error message and not store the event

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cricket score operator, I want to correct previously entered scores, so that I can fix mistakes without disrupting the live broadcast.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an operator corrects a past score THEN the system SHALL create a correction event with version increment and store previous data
2. WHEN a correction is made THEN the system SHALL recompute all subsequent scores and broadcast the updated totals
3. WHEN a correction occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain the original event for audit purposes with eventType "correction"
4. IF a correction is made for a non-existent event THEN the system SHALL treat it as a new event

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cricket viewer, I want to see live scores update in real-time, so that I can follow the match as it happens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a score is updated THEN all connected clients SHALL receive the new score within 100ms
2. WHEN a correction is made THEN the displayed score SHALL update seamlessly without page refresh or jarring changes
3. WHEN viewing the application THEN the system SHALL display current total runs, wickets, and over.ball format
4. WHEN multiple browser tabs are open THEN all tabs SHALL show synchronized scores

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cricket viewer, I want to see a log of recent score updates, so that I can understand what changes have been made.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scores are updated THEN the system SHALL display a chronological log of recent events
2. WHEN a correction is made THEN the log SHALL clearly indicate it as a correction with previous and new values
3. WHEN viewing the log THEN each entry SHALL show over.ball, runs, wicket status, and timestamp
4. IF the log exceeds 20 entries THEN the system SHALL show only the most recent 20 entries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive event storage with audit trails, so that I can track all changes and maintain data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any score event occurs THEN the system SHALL store it with matchId, over, ball, runs, wicket, timestamp, eventType, version, and enteredBy fields
2. WHEN a correction is made THEN the system SHALL store previousData containing the original values
3. WHEN querying events THEN the system SHALL support efficient retrieval by matchId, over.ball key, and timestamp
4. IF multiple corrections occur for the same event THEN the system SHALL increment version numbers sequentially

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated score simulation capabilities, so that I can demonstrate the system's correction handling without manual input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation is triggered THEN the system SHALL generate a predefined sequence from over 4.1 to 5.1
2. WHEN simulating THEN the system SHALL include a deliberate error on 4.2 (6 runs instead of 0) followed by correction after 4.5
3. WHEN running simulation THEN each event SHALL be sent with 2-3 second delays to mimic real-time entry
4. IF simulation fails for any event THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a cricket viewer, I want the application to work across multiple devices and screen sizes, so that I can follow scores on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive and usable
2. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN all score information SHALL remain clearly visible and accessible
3. WHEN using touch devices THEN all interactive elements SHALL be appropriately sized for touch input
4. IF the connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to handle multiple concurrent matches, so that it can scale for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple matches are active THEN each match SHALL be isolated by matchId in separate Socket.io rooms
2. WHEN storing events THEN the system SHALL support multiple concurrent matches without data conflicts
3. WHEN clients connect THEN they SHALL only receive updates for their specific match
4. IF no matchId is specified THEN the system SHALL default to "default" matchId

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation between frontend and backend services, so that the system is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs data THEN it SHALL communicate with the backend only through defined API endpoints
2. WHEN the backend processes events THEN it SHALL be independent of frontend implementation details
3. WHEN deploying THEN the frontend and backend SHALL be able to run on separate servers
4. IF either service fails THEN the other SHALL continue operating independently where possible

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a cricket viewer, I want to manually enter scores through a web form, so that I can test the system or enter scores when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the web form THEN I SHALL be able to input over, ball, runs, wicket status, and matchId
2. WHEN submitting the form THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and provide immediate feedback
3. WHEN form submission succeeds THEN the form SHALL reset for the next entry
4. IF form submission fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and retain the entered data
